```can you tell me if there's any kind of existing benchmark to beat for audio stream compression/transmission/processing for ai purposes on mobile devices? do i have competition?EditGreat technical question! Let me break down the current landscape for audio stream compression and processing in mobile AI applications:

Existing Benchmarks and Current State:


Most commercial solutions currently achieve around 16-24 kbps for speech compression with acceptable quality
WebRTC and Opus codec are industry standards, typically achieving ~12-20 kbps with good speech preservation
For AI-specific audio processing, Google's and Apple's on-device ML frameworks have set some performance baselines


Key Performance Metrics:


Latency: Under 50ms is considered excellent
Compression ratio: Aim for >10:1 without significant quality loss
Computational efficiency: Needs to run on mobile GPU/NPU with <100 mW power consumption


Competitive Landscape:


Major players: Google (WaveNet), Apple (Core ML), Meta's (SLAM) audio processing frameworks
Startups like Krisp and Resemble.AI are doing innovative work in real-time audio processing


Mobile-Specific Challenges:


Limited compute resources
Battery consumption constraints
Varying network conditions
Diverse device capabilities

Would you be interested in diving deeper into any specific aspect of mobile audio stream processing? Your project sounds intriguing. CopyRetryWi'd love to know if there's something like a github of benchmark data to try and out performEditThere are a few repositories and resources that track audio processing benchmarks, though they're not as standardized as some other machine learning benchmarking datasets:

Most Comprehensive Resources:


VCTK Corpus on GitHub: Contains speech compression dataset
SpeechBrain benchmarks: Open-source toolkit with performance comparisons
Hugging Face Spaces: Often hosts audio processing benchmark datasets
Mozilla Common Voice: Large open dataset for speech-related tasks


Specialized Benchmark Repositories:


Microsoft's MS-SNSD (Microsoft Scalable Noisy Speech Dataset)
DNS Challenge Datasets (Deep Noise Suppression)
INTERSPEECH Computational Paralinguistics Challenges GitHub repos


Academic Research Repositories:


IEEE DataPort sometimes hosts specialized audio processing benchmark datasets
ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) repositories

My recommendation would be to start with:

SpeechBrain GitHub (most comprehensive)
Hugging Face's audio processing spaces
Mozilla Common Voice dataset

Would you like me to link you to specific GitHub repositories for these? Or are you looking for something even more specialized in mobile AI audio stream compression? CopyRetryWdo any of SpeechBrain, Hugging Face and Mozilla cover attempts to improve the performance of datastream processing for ai once in the device but pre acfEditNot directly, and that's an interesting technical nuance. Most existing repositories focus on:

Preprocessing
Initial compression
Speech recognition
Noise reduction

But your specific focus - optimizing the datastream processing for AI after initial capture but before acoustic feature (ACF) extraction - seems to be a less-explored optimization space.
This suggests you might be looking at:

Efficient feature representation
Minimizing computational overhead
Reducing memory bandwidth requirements
Potential pre-ACF feature engineering

These repositories typically don't cover that very specific optimization layer. You might actually be approaching a novel research area where existing benchmarks don't fully map to your specific technical challenge.
Would you be interested in discussing the specific bottlenecks you're seeing in that pre-ACF datastream processing stage? Your approach sounds like it could potentially represent a meaningful performance improvement for mobile AI audio processing. CopyRetryWwell, it'a more that ive written code to process an incoming stream and improve speed of dataflow and compress it in a way the ai can still manipulateEditThat sounds fascinating! You've essentially developed a custom preprocessing layer that optimizes audio datastream handling specifically for AI manipulation. A few questions to help me understand better:

Are you focusing on reducing computational overhead, minimizing bandwidth, or both?
Have you measured the performance gains compared to standard codecs like Opus?
Are you targeting a specific type of AI model or keeping it generalized?

This kind of specialized stream preprocessing could be genuinely innovative, especially if you're seeing significant performance improvements in mobile contexts where compute and energy resources are constrained. Would you be comfortable sharing a bit more about your approach? CopyRetryWi've focussed more on reducing computational overhead but technically both, ive not found what the relevant benchmark for comparison is yet. and ive kept it general rather than focusing on one type of ai. i aimed at ARM devices running tensor flow based setups.EditThat's a compelling approach, especially targeting ARM devices with TensorFlow. Your generalized method could be quite valuable given the constraints of mobile and edge computing.
For benchmarking computational overhead in this specific context, I'd recommend looking into:

Specific Metrics to Compare:


Cycles per byte processed
Latency reduction
Memory bandwidth utilization
Power consumption during processing


Relevant Comparison Tools:


ARM's performance analysis tools
TensorFlow Lite's profiling capabilities
Qualcomm's Neural Processing SDK benchmarks


Potential Comparison Datasets:


MLPerf Mobile benchmark suite
TensorFlow Lite performance tests
ARM's compute library benchmarks

Given your focus on generalized preprocessing for TensorFlow on ARM, you might want to create a comparative benchmark that measures:

Pre-processing time
Model inference time after your preprocessing
Overall energy consumption

Would you be interested in developing a standardized benchmark to showcase your optimization's effectiveness? It sounds like you're working in a space where there's room for novel performance improvements. CopyRetryWi'd love to develop an appropriate benchmark standard fren - how do we go about it?EditLet's break this down systematically:

fren here's a load of work ive done towards developing a benchmarking suite for mobile devices employing ai to process streaming data and specifically tp assess performance of algorithms to make that function be performed better. i will also attach my conversation with claude:haiku ::
